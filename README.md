# pedestrian_detection

## Introduction
I tried three pedestrian detection algorithm. The program can track moving pedestrians in the video. In folder part1, I used two algorithms
to detect pedestrians in a video whose background is static. In imgdif.m, I used frame difference method. In backdif.m, I used background 
difference method. In folder part2, I tried to detect moving pedestrians in a video whose background is not static. The method I used in 
zhongx.m is window tracing method.

## Results
The process of frame difference
